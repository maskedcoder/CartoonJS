# CartoonJS

JavaScript + Canvas + Animation = Cartoons!

CartoonJS is an HTML5-based animation framework for building canvas animations

## Example

Here is an example html file:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="controls.css" />
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="container"><div id="animation-controls-container"></div></div>
            <script src="cartoon.js"></script>
            <script src="my_example_cartoon.js"></script>
        </body>
    </html>

The css file is only necessary for the default interface.

Here is an example of a simple animation:

    // Create a canvas
    var canvas = new CartoonCanvas("container");

    // Make a square
    var square = new CartoonPathItem("square")
                    .moveTo(-50,-50)
                    .lineTo(-50,50)
                    .lineTo(50,50)
                    .lineTo(50,-50)
                    .lineTo(-50,-50);
    // Turn the square 45 degrees
    square.rotation = 45;
    // Make the square red with thick lines
    square.attr({
        "fillStyle": "#f00",
        "lineWidth": 3
    });
    // Put the square in the canvas
    canvas.addItem(square);

    // Create the animation and create a gui to control it
    var animation = new CartoonAnimation(true);

    // Create a scene for our animation
    var scene = new AnimationScene(canvas);

    // Make the square do a complete rotation in 2 seconds
    scene.addKeyFrame(square, 2000, "rotation", 405);
    // Make the square move to the right 100 pixels
    scene.addKeyFrame(square, 2000, "x", 100);
    

    // Make this scene appear in the animation at the start
    animation.addScene(scene, 0);

    // Send the animation to the beginning
    animation.stop();

## API

### CartoonCanvas

Provides an interface for the HTML5 canvas. Each CartoonCanvas can hold multiple Cartoon Items and one Background object.

#### CartoonCanvas Properties

- `canvas` : The canvas element that will be drawn on
- `ctext` : The CanvasRenderingContext2D for the canvas element
- `height` : The height of the canvas
- `width` : The width of the canvas

#### CartoonCanvas Methods

##### CartoonCanvas([element][, width [, height]]) -> new CartoonCanvas

Creates an empty CartoonCanvas.

- `element` : HTML element or an id to select. If the element is not a canvas, a new canvas element will be created and nested inside
- `width` : (default: `500`) The width of the canvas
- `height` : (default: `300`) The height of the canvas

##### CartoonCanvas.addItem(item) -> null

Puts a Cartoon Item in the list of items to draw every refresh.

- `item` : a Cartoon Item

##### CartoonCanvas.draw() -> null

Clears the canvas element and draws the background and all child Cartoon Items. No changes made to child Cartoon Items or the background will be represented until this function is called.

##### CartoonCanvas.getItem(name) -> Cartoon Item

Fetches a Cartoon Item from the CartoonCanvas's list.

- `name` : (`string`) The name of the Cartoon Item to fetch

##### CartoonCanvas.removeItem(name) -> null

Removes a Cartoon Item from the CartoonCanvas

- `name` : (`string`) The name of the Cartoon Item to remove

### Background

Represents a background canvas. The Background object gets its own canvas to draw on to speed up rendering. Background objects cannot hold children, and do not draw anything by default. In order to use one, you must overwrite the `draw()` function. For example,

    var bg = new Background("container");
    bg.draw = function () {
        // Paints the entire canvas red
        this.ctext.fillStyle = "red";
        this.ctext.fillRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);
    };

#### Background Properties

- `canvas` : The canvas element that will be drawn on
- `ctext` : The CanvasRenderingContext2D for the canvas element
- `height` : The height of the canvas
- `width` : The width of the canvas

#### Background Methods

##### Background([element][, width [, height]]) -> new Background

Creates an empty Background

- `element` : HTML element or an id to select. If the element is not a canvas, a new canvas element will be created and nested inside
-  `width` : (default: `500`) The width of the canvas
- `height` : (default: `300`) The height of the canvas

##### Background.draw() -> null

Gets called whenever the parent CartoonCanvas is refreshed. By default, this function only prints warning. In order to do anything useful, this method must be overwritten.

### CartoonPathItem

Represents an path made up of points connected by lines, curves, and gaps that will be drawn on a canvas. Every CartoonPathItem controls the actual drawing process. If you're wanting to create a custom object, use GenericCartoonItem instead.

The CartoonPathItem stores a list of points in the format:

    {
        x: [number],
        y: [number],
        type: [move, arc, curve, quadraticCurve, bezierCurve, line, control1, or control2]
    }

If a vertex is the beginning of an arc segment, it will have the additional attribute `radius`.

When the draw function is called, the CartoonPathItem will customize the canvas context's attributes and then run a series of commands to draw a shape.

One Cartoon Item can be the parent of another, which means that the parent's location, rotation, or scale change, the child will change equally. For complex animating, a Matrix can be created and given permission to adjust the location, rotation, or scale of specific points in the Cartoon Item. CartoonPathItems, CartoonImageItems, and GenericCartoonItems can all be parents of one another.

#### CartoonPathItem Properties

- `attrs` : An object that stores custom drawing data, which will be applied to the canvas rendering context before drawing
- `boneMatrices` : An object listing all of the matrices that can act on this CartoonPathItem
- `closePath` : (default: `true`) Whether or not to close the path
- `name` : The name of the CartoonPathItem. Don't reuse names.
- `originX` : (default: `0`) The x component of the point that the CartoonPathItem will be rotated around
- `originY` : (default: `0`) The y component of the point that the CartoonPathItem will be rotated around
- `parent` : A reference to the parent CartoonPathItem, if any
- `path` : A list of vertices that make up the path
- `reverse` : Whether or not to draw the path with left and right swapped
- `rotation` : (default: `0`) The rotation of the CartoonPathItem
- `scale` : (default: `1`) The scale of the CartoonPathItem
- `visible` : (default: `true`) Whether or not to draw the CartoonPathItem
- `x` : (default: `0`) The x position of the CartoonPathItem
- `y`: (default: `0`) The y position of the CartoonPathItem

The `attrs` object is used to customize the CanvasRenderingContext2D before drawing. For more information on these attributes, see the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#Attributes "CanvasRenderingContext2D").

These are the settings controlled by the `attrs` object:

- `fillStyle` : (default: `#000`) Color or style to use inside shapes

- `shadowOffsetX` : (default: `0`) Horizontal distance the shadow will be offset
- `shadowOffsetY` : (default: `0`) Vertical distance the shadow will be offset
- `strokeStyle` : (default: `#000`) Color or style to use for the lines around shapes
- `textAlign` : (default: `start`) The horizontal alignment to use for text. Options are:
    - `center`
    - `end`
    - `left`

    - `middle`
    - `top`

#### CartoonPathItem Methods

##### CartoonPathItem([name]) -> new CartoonPathItem

Creates a new CartoonPathItem identified by `name`. **Warning:** do not reuse names for Cartoon Items in the same CartoonCanvas. When a new Cartoon Item is added to a CartoonCanvas that has another by that name, the old one will be mysteriously removed, without warning.

- `name` : A string to uniquely identify the CartoonPathItem

##### CartoonPathItem.setParent(p) -> bool

Attempts to set `p` as this CartoonPathItem's parent. A parent item will have indirect control over the location, scale, and rotation of a child Cartoon Item. The child's own geometric properties will not reflect any changes to the parent, but before every drawing, the context will be transformed into the parent's local coordinate system before drawing the child.

To make a child independant, run `CartoonPathItem.setParent(null);`.

- `p` : A CartoonPathItem to become parent, or null to remove a parent-child relationship

##### CartoonPathItem.addBone(bone) -> this

Adds `bone` to this CartoonPathItem's list of matrices. This CartoonPathItem is returned.

- `bone` : A Matrix object

##### CartoonPathItem.setBoneSegments(bonename, segmentlist) -> this

Attempts to replace any list of segments that the Matrix identified by `bonename` controls with `segmentlist`. If `bonename` points to a Matrix not in the CartoonPathItem's list, the function will return false. If the operation succeeds, this CartoonPathItem is returned.

- `bonename` : A Matrix object or name of a Matrix object in the CartoonPathItem's list of matrices
- `segmentlist` : A list of indexes of vertices in `CartoonPathItem.path`

##### CartoonPathItem.beginBone(bone) -> this

Tells the CartoonPathItem to assign all new vertices to `bone` until `CartoonPathItem.endBone()` is called. If the Matrix given is not in the CartoonPathItem's list of matrices, it will be added. This CartoonPathItem is returned.

- `bone` : A Matrix object

##### CartoonPathItem.endBone() -> this

Tells the CartoonPathItem to stop assigning all new vertices to the Matrix object that was specified in `CartoonPathItem.beginBone()`. This is not necessary when switching immediately from one Matrix to the next, but it provides some clarity. This CartoonPathItem is returned/

##### CartoonPathItem.draw(scene) -> null

Draws the CartoonPathItem, using the CanvasRenderingContext2D represented by `scene`. First, `scene` is customized with the attributes in `this.attrs`, then the points in the path are calculated in global coordinates (based on adjustments from parent CartoonPathItems or Matrices in the CartoonPathItem's list), then the function iterates through the list of commands associated with each point to draw a path on the canvas, and finally the path is filled and stroked. **Warning:** After drawing, the CanvasRenderingContext2D will still carry the custom attributes. If another object is drawn without changing the custom attributes, it will be drawn with those same old custom attributes.

- `scene` : A CanvasRenderingContext2D

##### CartoonPathItem.getPath() -> Array

Returns the list of point that make up this CartoonPathItem's path.

##### CartoonPathItem.bezierCurveTo(x, y, cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2) -> this

Adds three points to the CartoonPathItem's path which describe a [bezierCurveTo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#bezierCurveTo%28%29) command. This CartoonPathItem is returned.

- `x`: The x coordinate of the destination of the curve
- `y` : The y coordinate of the destination of the curve
- `cx1` : The x coordinate of the first control point
- `cy1` : The y coordinate of the first control point
- `cx2` : The x coordinate of the second control point
- `cy2` : The y coordinate of the second control point

##### CartoonPathItem.quadraticCurveTo(x, y, cx, cy) -> this

Adds two points to the CartoonPathItem's path which describe a [quadraticCurveTo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#quadraticCurveTo%28%29). This CartoonPathItem is returned.

- `x` : The x coordinate of the destination of the curve
- `y` : The y coordinate of the destination of the curve
- `cx` : The x coordinate of the control point
- `cy` : The y coordinate of the control point

##### CartoonPathItem.arcTo(x, y, x2, y2, radius) -> this

Adds two points to the CartoonPathItem's path which describe an [arcTo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#arcTo%28%29). For a more in-depth explanation of how arcTo commands work, see [DBP-Consulting](http://www.dbp-consulting.com/tutorials/canvas/CanvasArcTo.html). This CartoonPathItem is returned.

### GenericCartoonItem

Represents a the bare necessities of a Cartoon Item, made to be entirely customized. The `draw()` function by default does nothing and is supposed to be overwritten. There are functions, `getGlobal()` and `customizeContext()`, which are meant to be used to set up the canvas according to the object's personal matrix and the drawing attributes in `this.attrs`.

#### GenericCartoonItem Methods

##### GenericCartoonItem([name]) -> new GenericCartoonItem

Creates a new GenericCartoonItem identified by `name`. **Warning:** do not reuse names for Cartoon Items in the same CartoonCanvas. When a new Cartoon Item is added to a CartoonCanvas that has another by that name, the old one will be mysteriously removed, without warning.

- `name` : A string to uniquely identify the GenericCartoonItem

##### GenericCartoonItem.setParent(p) -> bool

Attempts to set `p` as this GenericCartoonItem's parent. A parent item will have indirect control over the location, scale, and rotation of a child Cartoon Item. The child's own geometric properties will not reflect any changes to the parent, but before every drawing, the context will be transformed into the parent's local coordinate system before drawing the child.

To make a child independant, run `GenericCartoonItem.setParent(null);`.

- `p` : A GenericCartoonItem to become parent, or null to remove a parent-child relationship

##### GenericCartoonItem.draw(scene) -> null

Should draw the item using the CanvasRenderingContext2d provided. This method does nothing by default; it should be overwritten to provide customized drawing for the item.

- `scene` : A CanvasRenderingContext2D

##### GenericCartoonItem.getGlobal(ctext) -> object

Transforms the CanvasRenderingContext2d based on the item's location, scale, and rotation, and those of all of the parent Cartoon Items. This function can be used inside the `draw()` function to relieve the burdon of manually calculating new positions for every point. In general, transforming the context itself is slower than calculating the global coordinates. The object returned specifies the origins for the x-axis and y-axis for the final parent Cartoon Item.

- `ctext` : A CanvasRenderingContext2D

##### GenericCartoonItem.customizeContext(ctext) -> object

Uses the attributes in `this.attrs` to customize the drawing of the CanvasRenderingContex2d provided. This is a convenience function that can be used inside `draw()`.

- `ctext` : A CanvasRenderingContext2D

##### GenericCartoonItem.attr(object) -> bool
##### GenericCartoonItem.attr(name, value) -> bool
##### GenericCartoonItem.attr(name) -> value

Gets or sets the GenericCartoonItem's attributes. If an object is given, the keys and values will be fed into this function, and return true if all were successful. If a name and value are given, the function will attempt to match the name up to an attribute and set it, returning true for success and false for failure. If just a name is given, the corresponding value for the attribute by that name will be returned, or false if there is no such attribute.

The attributes availible for getting or setting are `x`, `y`, `rotation`, `scale`, `path`, `reverse`, `visible`, and anything in `this.attrs`.

- `object` : An object with key/value pairs corresponding to this GenericCartoonItem's attributes.
- `name` : The name of an attribute
- `value` : The new value for an attribute

### CartoonImageItem

Represents an image that will be drawn on the CartoonCanvas. A CartoonImageItem can be moved and resized just as easily as CartoonPathItems and GenericCartoonItems.

#### CartoonImageItem Properties

- `attrs` : An object that stores custom drawing data, which will be applied to the canvas rendering context before drawing
- `img` : The Image which the CartoonImageItem will draw onto the canvas
- `name` : The name of the CartoonImageItem. Don't reuse names.
- `originX` : (default: `0`) The x component of the point that the CartoonImageItem will be rotated around
- `originY` : (default: `0`) The y component of the point that the CartoonImageItem will be rotated around
- `parent` : A reference to the parent CartoonImageItem, if any
- `reverse` : Whether or not to draw the path with left and right swapped

The `attrs` object is used to customize the CanvasRenderingContext2D before drawing. For more information on these attributes, see the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#Attributes "CanvasRenderingContext2D").

These are the settings controlled by the `attrs` object:

- `globalAlpha` : (default: `1.0`) Controls opacity; values from 0 (invisible) to 1.0 (completely opaque)
- `globalCompositeOperation` : (default: `source-over`) With `globalAlpha` applied this sets how shapes and images are drawn onto the existing bitmap. Options are:
    - `source-atop`
    - `source-in`
    - `source-out`
    - `source-over` (default)
    - `destination-atop`
    - `destination-in`
    - `destination-out`
    - `destination-over`
    - `lighter`
    - `darker`
    - `copy`

- `name` : A string to uniquely identify the CartoonImageItem
- `picture` : An Image to draw

##### CartoonImageItem.setParent(p) -> bool

Attempts to set `p` as this CartoonImageItem's parent. A parent item will have indirect control over the location, scale, and rotation of a child Cartoon Item. The child's own geometric properties will not reflect any changes to the parent, but before every drawing, the context will be transformed into the parent's local coordinate system before drawing the child.

To make a child independant, run `CartoonImageItem.setParent(null);`.

- `p` : A CartoonImageItem to become parent, or null to remove a parent-child relationship

##### CartoonImageItem.draw(scene) -> null

Draws the CartoonImageItem using the CanvasRenderingContext2d provided, first transforming the global context into the local coordinates of the CartoonImageItem.

- `scene` : A CanvasRenderingContext2D

##### CartoonImageItem.attr(object) -> bool
##### CartoonImageItem.attr(name, value) -> bool
##### CartoonImageItem.attr(name) -> value

Gets or sets the CartoonImageItem's attributes. If an object is given, the keys and values will be fed into this function, and return true if all were successful. If a name and value are given, the function will attempt to match the name up to an attribute and set it, returning true for success and false for failure. If just a name is given, the corresponding value for the attribute by that name will be returned, or false if there is no such attribute.

The attributes availible for getting or setting are `x`, `y`, `rotation`, `scale`, `path`, `reverse`, `visible`, and anything in `this.attrs`.

- `object` : An object with key/value pairs corresponding to this CartoonImageItem's attributes.
- `name` : The name of an attribute

### Matrix

Represents an invisible object which can be used to control Cartoon Items or even the vertices that make up a CartoonPathItem.

#### Matrix Properties

#### Matrix Methods

##### Matrix([name]) -> new Matrix object

Creates a new Matrix, identified by `name`. **Warning:** A Matrix's name can interfere with Cartoon Item names, if it is added to a CartoonScene, so it would be best to name it something unique.

- `name` : The a string that uniquely identifies the Matrix

##### Matrix.setMatrix(other) -> bool

Sets the `other` as this Matrix's parent, with indirect control over location, rotation, and scale. To remove a parent from control, run `Matrix.setMatrix(null);`. Returns true if the operation was successful.

- `other` : A Matrix object

##### Matrix.draw() -> null

Pretends to draw the Matrix. Nothing happens by default, because Matrices are supposed to be the invisible workers that manipulate Cartoon Items into performing their maniacal whims.

##### Matrix.attr(object) -> bool
##### Matrix.attr(name, value) -> bool
##### Matrix.attr(name) -> value

Gets or sets the Matrix's attributes. If an object is given, the keys and values will be fed into this function, and return true if all were successful. If a name and value are given, the function will attempt to match the name up to an attribute and set it, returning true for success and false for failure. If just a name is given, the corresponding value for the attribute by that name will be returned, or false if there is no such attribute.

The attributes availible for getting or setting are `x`, `y`, `rotation`, `scale`.

- `object` : An object with key/value pairs corresponding to this Matrix's attributes.
- `name` : The name of an attribute
- `value` : The new value for an attribute

### Animation

Provides an interface for creating and playing an animation.

#### Animation Properties

- `time` : The number of milliseconds after the beginning of the animation
- `status` : A string telling the status of the animation. Changing the value of this property will tell the Animation what to do the next tick. Possible values:
    - `ready`
    - `playing`
    - `paused`

  Other values will be interpreted as `playing`
- `onstep` : May contain a callback to be called at the start of every step in the Animation
- `onstatus` : May contain a callback to be called whenever the status of the Animation changes
- `scenes` : An object containing all the AnimationScenes that are in the Animation, with the time each AnimationScene begins as the key
- `sceneChanges` : A reverse-order array of scene change times
- `lastframe` : The time after which the Animation will stop playing. This means that the final frame may be several milliseconds after this time. Normally, this value will be calculated automatically.
- `audio` : An audio element, if given, to play during the Animation. Things work out best if the duration of the soundtrack is equal to that of the Animation

#### Animation Methods

##### Animation(makeControls) -> new Animation object

Creates a new animation. If `makeControls` is `true`, the controls for the animation will be placed inside the element with the id 'animation-controls-container'. Otherwise, controls will have to be implemented by hand.

- `makeControls` : Whether or not a gui should be automatically generated

##### Animation.createControls() -> new Controls object

Builds the controls for the animation inside the element specified. The controls will be placed inside the element with the id 'animation-controls-container'.

##### Animation.addScene(scene, time) -> null

Adds an AnimationScene to the queue of scenes. At the time given, the AnimationScene will become visible, and the previous one will be hidden.

- `scene` : An AnimationScene
- `time` : A time during the animation

##### Animation.addAudio(audio) -> null

Gives the Animation an HTML audio element to control whenever the user pushes one of the Animation's controls. Things will get kind of wacky if the duration of the audio isn't equal to the duration of the animation. An Animation can only control one audio element. Subsequent calls will only change which lucky element gets the esteemed position of being controlled by the Animation, instead of making more than one be controlled.

- `audio` : An HTML audio element

##### Animation.togglePlay() -> null

Toggles the Animation between playing and pausing. If the Animation is at the start, it will get started. This is the function that should get called whenever the user pushes the play/pause button.

##### Animation.play() -> null

Sets the Animation in motion, starting at the beginning. To get the Animation to play from a paused state, use `Animation.resume()` instead.

##### Animation.stop() -> null

Stops the Animation from playing and sends it back to the start, rendering the first frame. This function may be used to initialize things, so there isn't a mess on the canvas before the user plays the animation. To just stop the playback instead of stopping and going back to the first frame, use `Animation.pause()`.

##### Animation.pause() -> null

Pauses the playback of the Animation. There may be a delay of a few milliseconds because it waits for the next frame to be drawn before stopping.

##### Animation.resume() -> null

Resumes the Animation from a pause.

##### Animation.setTime(time) -> null

Moves the Animation to the given time and draws a frame for that time. The state of the Animation will not change.

- `time` : A time during the animation

##### Animation.back15() -> null

Sends the Animation backward 15 seconds, or to the start, if the current time is less than 15 seconds.

### AnimationScene

Represents a scene during an Animation. Each scene gets to keep track of key frames. The Animation checks each step to see what AnimationScene is active; the active AnimationScene checks each step to see what Cartoon Items are changing, and these changes finally get drawn.

#### AnimationScene Properties

- `background` : Background object to show or hide when the scene changes
- `scene` : The CartoonCanvas on which the action takes place
- `lastframe` : The time of the last frame in the AnimationScene
- `hidden` : Whether or not the AnimationScene's corresponding CartoonCanvas and Background are hidden

#### AnimationScene Methods

##### AnimationScene(scene[, background]) -> new AnimationScene

Creates a new AnimationScene.

- `scene` : A CartoonCanvas object on which all the animations will be drawn
- `background` : An optional Background object which will be drawn one time, when the AnimationScene is first shown, and remains constant for the duration of the scene. It will be redrawn any time the user makes the Animation jump to any time that the AnimationScene is active.

##### AnimationScene.hide() -> null

Hides the HTML canvases that are controlled by the CanvasScene in `this.scene` and the Background (if any) in `this.background`. There is no real need to use this function. The CartoonAnimation will automatically make AnimationScenes appear and disappear.

##### AnimationScene.show() -> null

Makes the HTML canvases that are controlled by the CanvasScene in `this.scene` and the Background (if any) in `this.background appear. There is no real need to use this function. The CartoonAnimation will automatically make AnimationScenes appear and disappear.

##### AnimationScene.stepAnimation(time, [update]) -> null

Draws the next frame in the sequence corresponding to this AnimationScene. First, all of the Cartoon Items that are being animated get are transformed based on the time given, then the CartoonScene in `this.scene` is drawn. If `update` is `true`, all the instantaneous Cartoon Item changes listed in `this.immediateTimeline` that are supposed to happen before the time `time` are made (even if unnecessary).

- `time` : An integer specifying the current time during the animation
- `update` : Whether or not to update all of the instantaneous transformations in `this.immediateTimeline`

##### AnimationScene.addKeyFrame(item, time, attr, val) -> null

Adds a key frame wherein the given Cartoon Item has the attribute `attr` equal to the value `val` at the given time. If the value for `time` is after the end of the animation, it will be changed to the time of the final frame. If the value for the attribute of the Cartoon Item is not the current value, and no other key frames for that attribute on that Cartoon Item have been added yet, a key frame for the current state will be added for the start of the animation. For example, if during the setting up code an object has the value for `x` equal to `0` (which is default), and a key frame is added for any time greater than `0` with a value other than `0`, a new key frame will be automatically created for `x` at the time `0` with the value of `0`. This is to avoid the tedium of having to add key frames fo the initial settings for all the attributes that will be animated.

The types of attributes that can be animated are paths, colors, and numbers. Gradients are not supported. Also, the color support is limited to hexidecimal formats, rgb(#,#,#), rgba(#,#,#,#), and basic keyword colors.

- `item` : A Cartoon Item or the name of a Cartoon Item
- `time` : The time for the key frame
- `attr` : A Cartoon Item [attribute](#cartoonpathitem-properties) to be animated
- `val` : The value of the Cartoon Item attribute

##### AnimationScene.addAttrChange(item, time, attr, val) -> null

Adds a key frame wherein the given Cartoon Item has the attribute `attr` equal to the value `val` at the given time. This is for Cartoon Item transformations that will take place instantaneously, with no transition between one value and the next. This is meant to be used for boolean Cartoon Item attributes, like `visible` or `reverse`. When the user triggers a jump from one time in the animation to a different time, no matter how small the jump, all of the instantaneous transformations that are to happen before the new time *will* be run through, whether or not they are necessary.

- `item` : A Cartoon Item or the name of a Cartoon Item
- `time` : The time for the key frame
- `attr` : A Cartoon Item [attribute](#cartoonpathitem-properties) to be animated, preferabbly one with a boolean value
- `val` : The value of the Cartoon Item attribute

##### AnimationScene.compile() -> null

Prepares the AnimationScene by compiling `this._timeline` into a series of SubAnimations which have low-level control over the actual animating. These SubAnimations are stored in `this._subAnimations`. There is no real need to use this function. The CartoonAnimation will automatically compile all the AnimationScenes before playing.

### Controls

Implements a graphical interface for the user to control the animation. The interface consists of:

- A clock displaying the time, in minutes and seconds, that the animation has taken so far
- A play/pause toggle button, which plays, pauses, and resumes the animation
- A stop button, which stops the playback of the animation and sends the animation back to the start
- A button to rewind the animation 15 seconds (or less, if the animation hasn't gone that far)
- A progress meter, which the user drag to move the playback to a different time

#### Controls Methods

##### Controls(animation) -> new Controls object

Creates the Controls object, which will control the Animation `animation`. The DOM elements that make up the interface will be placed inside the element with the id 'animation-controls-container' (for styling purposes).

- `animation` : The Animation object that the user will control

##### Controls.step(time, total) -> null

Updates the clock to display the current time, and moves the progress meter. The total duration is necessary to calculate the percentage completion of the animation.

- `time` : The current time of the Animation
- `total` : The duration of the Animation

##### Controls.state(state) -> null

Updates the state of the play/pause button. If the Animation is playing, the button has a pause symbol. Otherwise, a play symbol is displayed.

- `state` : The state of the Animation, either `play`, `ready`, or `pause`
